# How to use this workbook

Welcome back to the Physical Computing Theme!

This session will be a workshop with lots of practical exercises that you can work through at your own pace. This is to ensure that you all gain something from this course, independent of your current Python and general programming knowledge.

We will work through this sheet as follows. For each of the following chapters, the tasks are grouped into **ascending order of difficulty**. Please attempt all tasks under **Mandatory exercises**, and if you have time before we move on, have fun with the **Optional exercises**.

**One plea**: If you are done earlier than your neighbour, please help us out by offering your help to them. Explaining something is a sure-fire way to really understand it yourself!

# Homework for the next Session

Any unfinished Mandatory Exercises from the Recap chapter will be your homework.

 **This is mandatory.** For assessing your homework, we expect a coded solution. However, if you really get stuck with an exercise, this is not a problem, and instead of program code, we need you to explain as well as you can where and how you got stuck. It is just as useful being able to describe what the problem is as it is to solve it.

# Writing Python programs on Raspberry Pi

## The Raspberry Pi computer

Raspberry Pi is a small computer the size of a credit card that you can plug into a monitor, keyboard and mouse. You can use it in the same way as you would use your desktop PC or laptop. You can generate spreadsheets, do word processing, browse the internet, and play games. It also plays high-definition video.

However, what will make it interesting for us is its capability for use in electronics projects! The main aim of the Raspberry Pi is to teach anyone how to use programming and electronics to realise their ideas. Raspberry Pi comes with a free Linux operating system that runs from an SD card, and it is powered by a USB phone charger.

## The tools of the trade - the Linux terminal and a code editor

But how about (a) writing, and (b) executing Python programs on the Rasberry Pi?

For writing programs, we suggest using **Geany**, which is one of the pre-installed code editors on your Raspberry Pi. It has the handy feature that it highlights (i.e., colour-annotates) our programs as we write them, which helps a lot with their readability.

You find Geany in the Programming menue, as shown in the following picture.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/Geany_menu_item.png" alt="Geany menue item" width="800">
    <figcaption align="center">Opening the Geany script editor</figcaption>
</p>

The user interface is rather self-explanatory, with commands like CTRL+S (save), CTRL+O (open a file) etc. working as expected. It looks like shown below. Note that the program text has been coloured automatically.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/Geany_window.png" alt="Geany window" width="800">
    <figcaption align="center">The Geany user interface</figcaption>
</p>

But how to actually run the program, so the computer can do what we ask it to do? That's where the Linux terminal comes in handy. Look again at the main menu bar in the Figure above. The terminal is the black symbol with <kbd>**>\_**</kbd> in it, at the top of the screen. Once you've clicked on it, the below window appears.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/Terminal_window.png" alt="The Linux terminal" width="600">
    <figcaption align="center">The Linux terminal</figcaption>
</p>

We will show you how you can run a program from within the Terminal. The most important Terminal commands are listed in the table below.

| Command       | Effect     | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| ```ls``` | List the contents of the current folder |
| ```cd``` _folder_ | **C**hange **d**irectory into _folder_ |
| ```cd ..``` | Change into the parent folder of the current folder |
| ```cd``` | ```cd``` without argument changes back to the user's home folder (/home/pi) |
| ```pwd``` | **P**resent **w**orking **d**irectory. This prints out the location of the current folder. |
| ```python3``` _program.py_ | Run the program called _program.py_ in Python 3 |

Hint: You can use tab completion. For example, when typing ```cd```+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, the Terminal automatically lists all possible folders that are available for changing into.

Long story short - the Terminal is much like a text-based file explorer, bolted together with a powerful general "command centre" for your computer. You can also start the usual programs from within the terminal. Just type ```chromium```+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.

# Recap of the Introductory Session

First off, are there any questions from the last session or the homework?

## Basic Python: Variables, Operators, Data Types

Programming languages hold data in variables. Just like in maths, variables in Python are a convenient way to refer to a quantity through a memorable name.

```Python
number_of_hands = 2 # Hold the value 2 in a variable called "number_of_hands"
fingers_per_hand = 5 # Hold the value 3 in a variable called "fingers_per_hand"
number_of_fingers = number_of_hands * fingers_per_hand # What value will this be?
```

Variable names must start with a letter and should only contain letters, numbers and underscores.

In this example, we used hashtags to mark everything behind them as **comments**, which are not executed.

Programming languages use different **data types** for different types of data. It's horses for courses with this, and unsurprisingly Python supports text, integers, floating point and Boolean data, to name a few.

For example:

```python
x  = 1
some_text = "Hello World!"
some_boolean = False
```

We can perform mathematical calculations in Python using the basic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`.

```python
4 + 5
4 - 3
2 * 3
3 / 4
2 ** 3
10 % 7 # Returns the remainder of a division
```

In Python, the [standard order of operations](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Basic_Math) is from left to right, and respects the mathematical precedence of operations (memorised by many as PEMDAS):

| Name        | Syntax     | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----|
| **P**arentheses     | ( ... ) | Happening before operating on anything else.|
| **E**xponents     | **  |  Exponents are evaluated before multiplication and division. |
| **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision | * / | |
| **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction | + -  | |

Let's try it:

```python
3 / 4 * 5  # First division and then multiplication
6 + 7 * 9
2 ** 8
10 % 7 # Remainder of a division
```

The following table lists Python's comparison operators. Operations involving these return the Boolean values `True` or `False`, depending on whether the statement is true or not.

| Name        | Syntax     |
| :-------------: |:-------------|
| < | Less than|
| > | Greater than|
| <=| Less than or equal to|
|>=	| Greater than or equal to|
|==	| Equal to|
|!=	| Not equal to|

You can combine logic statements using the keywords `and`, `or` and `not`. What will the following statements return?

```python
2 == 3
3 == 3
2 < 3
True == (False != True)
"Asterix" == "Obelix" or not("Idefix" == "Idefix")
```

There are more operators, which you can read about [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm).

## Strings, Lists and Indexing

The data stored in memory can be of different types; Python has five basic ones: **Numbers** and **Strings**, which we have encountered above, and also **List**, which we will touch upon below. (We won't have time to cover the [**Tuple**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.htm) and [**Dictionary**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm) types.)

Re-using the above:

```python
type(number_of_hands) # Number
type(fingers_per_hand)
type(some_text) # String
```

**Strings** in Python are a set of characters grouped together in quotation marks. Python allows either a pair of single or double quotes.

**Lists** are the most versatile data types in Python. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets `[ ... ]`. In Python, all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.

The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator (`[]` and `[:]`) with indexes **starting at 0 at the beginning of the list**. That's a popular stumbling block, so beware!

The plus sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (`*`) is the repetition operator.

```python
list = [ 'abc', 12 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
tinylist = [123, 'john']

my_name = "John Doe"
my_job = "technician"

print(list)            # Prints complete list
print(list[0])         # Prints first element of the list
print(list[1:3])       # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd
print(list[2:])        # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print(list[-1])        # Negative indexing: Prints the last element of the list
print(tinylist * 2)    # Prints list two times
print(list + tinylist) # Prints concatenated lists

print(my_name[0])      # Strings behave very similarly to lists
print(my_name + my_job)# String concatenation
```

Finally, you can use the `len(...)` function to find the length of a list or string.

## Control flow

We have so far seen many small bits of software that fulfil one specific task at a time (like assigning a value to a variable, or accepting user input). In order to tackle more complex tasks, we need to combine many of these items into one larger computer program. Think of programs as cooking recipes: They are a sequence of statements (i.e., lines of code), to be executed by a very quick and accurate, but also adhere-to-the-letter type of cook (your Raspberry Pi).

As programmers, we set up “paths” for the program to follow. Can you tell the output of the program?

<p align="center">
<img src="images/Flow1.png" alt="pin" width="90">
</p>

## Conditional statements

Conditional statements allow the program to react to new information _whilst it is running_ ("at runtime").

We use the `if (...):`-`elif (...):`-`else:` construct for this scenario. For example &ndash;

```python
weight = input("Please input your weight in kg: ")
height = input("Please input your height in m: ")
# Need to convert strings to actual number types, using the float(...) function
bmi = float(weight) / float(height) ** 2
if (bmi >=16 and bmi < 18.5):
    print("Your BMI looks a bit low (underweight).")
elif (bmi >= 18.5 and bmi < 25):
    print("Your BMI is considered healthy.")
elif (bmi >= 25 and bmi < 30):
    print("Your BMI looks a bit large (overweight).")
else:
    print("According to your BMI, you are severely over- or underweight.")
```

Two important points to remember:
1. **Code blocks that are executed inside an `if`/`elif`/`else` statement are indented with a tab. This is Python's way to group code into blocks.**
2. **These code blocks start after a colon and end when the indentation stops.**

## Repeating code: Loops

Often, we need an action to be repeated. One way to achieve this is to use a `while` loop:

```python
count = 0
while (count < 9):
    print 'The count is:', count
    count = count + 1
print "Goodbye!"
```

To run through a list of things, we can use a `for` loop:

```python
my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
for number in my_numbers:
    print(number ** 2)
```

## Functions

Functions enable you to "recycle" blocks of related code at different places in your program.

A function is a block of organised, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

```python
# Import a maths library for accessing the value of pi
import numpy as np

# Function that calculates the area of a circle from its radius
def get_area(radius):
    area = np.pi * radius ** 2
    return area

radii = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

for radius in radii:
    area = get_area(radius)
    print("The area of a circle of radius " + radius +
          " cm is " + area + " cm^2.")
print "Done."
```

Functions are _defined_ using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, and any arguments in brackets. Functions return a value using the `return` keyword.

## User input

The following python code accepts user input and stores it in the variable `my_number`.

```python
my_number = ''
my_number = input('Please tell me a number! ')
if (my_number == '42'):
    print('Amazing. You\'re on to something!')
else:
    print('That\'s a lovely number.')
```

**The output of the `input()` function is always a string, even if you input `'42'`. You need to change the type of this variable to `number` first if you want to "do maths" with it later. For this, use the `int()` or `float()` function, for example by calling `my_number = int(my_number)`.**

## When things don't go to plan

When your program has run down a dead end, Python does its best to help you out of it, by printing out a help message into the Terminal.

Consider the following program:

```python
my_number = input("Please input a number: ")
output = my_number / 2
print(output)
```

Saving it as `test.py` and executing (inside the same folder where you saved it!) `python3 test.py`, the following will happen, assuming the user inputs "25" and presses <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

```bash
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ python3 test.py
Please input a number: 25
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 2, in <module>
    output = my_number / 2
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'
```

Can someone explain what this "Traceback" is complaining about, and how to correct it?

## Mandatory exercises

Following on from the Introductory Session and your homework, can you solve the following tasks?

1. Program the following flow chart in Python.
   <p align="center">
   	  <img src="images/IfElseExercise.png" alt="pin" width="400">
   </p>

1. Program the below flow chart in Python. Ask the user to input sensible answers.
   <p align="center">
 	  <img src="images/engineering-flow-chart.png" alt="pin" width="400">
   </p>

1. Write a program that produces the following output.
   ``` python
   My number is 24
   My number is 36
   My number is 48
   My number is 60
   ```
   
1. String manipulation. Check whether a word is a palindrome. _Palindromes_ are words that read the same forwards and backwards, for example _madam_ or _racecar_.


## Optional exercises

1. Choose a library that can perform HTTP GET requests (there is one by that very name that looks promising, see below). Can you write a program that grabs the current temperature and wind speed for a user-input location and displays it nicely in the terminal? If you're really keen and have a peek at the next chapter, can you get it to light an led if the temperature is above 15°C?
 
   For this, you will need to find an on-line source of weather data. You can use Google and scrape the text body of the response for the temperature (one way to do that is to use [_regular expressions_](https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html), which can be used in Python through the [re](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/re.html) module).

   Alternatively there are on-line services that offer the data free of charge ([e.g., this one](https://openweathermap.org/api)) and in a nice format called [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) ([example here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example)), but you need to sign up for them first. In both cases, you will need to construct the URL you request off the service depending on the user-requested location, and maybe some more bits of information such as your user ID if you signed up to a service.

1. Can you program Eratosthenes' sieve? Additional difficulty: Create a program that gives all prime numbers between a lower and an upper number, for example to find all primes between 10,000 and 11,000? [More information here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

1. (You got as far as this? Ok, fair dos. Start work on an implementation of [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm). You will have to decide on a data structure to hold a graph, amongst many other considerations.)

# Physical Computing and the gpiozero library

Ultimately, we want you to control a physical contraption with your Raspberry Pi. For this, we'll use the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins on the side of your Pi. Their layout is shown below. Don't worry too much about it all for now, we will show you how to connect things up. Just one thing to remember: **Never connect a 5V pin directly to any other pin of the Raspberry Pi, particularly the Ground pin!**

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/RPi_pin_layout.svg" alt="pin" width="200">
    <figcaption align="center">Raspberry Pi pin layout</figcaption>
</p>

## Working with libraries

You've seen the `import` statement in the last session, when we imported the newer `print()` function into Python2. We also used `import numpy as np` and later `np.pi` to access the value of the mathematical constant &pi;.

The whole point is to avoid "re-inventing the wheel" by using existing software inside our programs. We do this by importing **software libraries**.

Here's an example for how powerful this idea is. Imagine you want to retrieve the raw HTML content from a website. Instead of manually coding everything up from scratch, we can do the following:

```python
import requests
r = requests.get('http://example.com') # Using everyone's favourite test domain!
print(r.content)
```

A whopping 3 lines of code to traverse the network stack, perform a HTTP GET request, await a response, save it in a variable called `r` and display it!

Things contained in libraries can be retrieved by using the dot operator `.`, such as in `requests.get`.

## Using the gpiozero library

The gpiozero library enables us to control the GPIO pins on our Pi. We start off with `import gpiozero`.

### Switching an LED

Connect an LED via a resistor to the Ground (GND) and GPIO pin 17 (GP17). Note that the shorter wire of the LED needs to connect to ground.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/gpiozero_led.png" alt="Connecting an LED" width="800">
    <figcaption align="center">Connecting an LED to the Pi</figcaption>
</p>

Run:

```python
import gpiozero
import time

red = gpiozero.LED(17)

while True:
    red.on()
    time.sleep(1)
    red.off()
    time.sleep(1)
```

Note how we also imported the `time` library to allow the program to sleep for one second.

### Dimming an LED

Keep the same connection, and run the below code. Note how we use the PWMLED object to control the LED. PWM stands for [**P**ulse **W**idth **M**odulation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Tutorial/pwm.gif), which rapidly blinks the LED and controls its brightness by switching it on and off for different amounts of times.

```python
from gpiozero import PWMLED
from time import sleep

led = PWMLED(17)

while True:
    led.value = 0  # off
    sleep(1)
    led.value = 0.5  # half brightness
    sleep(1)
    led.value = 1  # full brightness
    sleep(1)
```

Note how in this case we have used the syntax `from <library> import <thing>` to import the `PWMLED` and `sleep` functions directly. This allowed us to skip repeatedly writing `time.sleep()` etc.

### Using an ultrasonic distance sensor

We couldn't get gpiozero's own `DistanceSensor` to give us any sensible distances! So we wrote a small library that you can use instead. Download the [ICAHSensor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/till-h/ICAHHorizons_Y2PhysComp/master/session%201/ICAHSensor.py) and save it wherever you run the below program. It provides an `ICAHSensor` object.

Wire the sensor as shown below. For this we need a breadboard, because the sensor's "Echo" returns a 5V signal, which is too much for the Pi's GPIO pins. To solve this, we have to build a small [voltage divider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider) to bring the signal from 5V down to 3.3V.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/gpiozero_distance_sensor.png" alt="Connecting an ultrasonic distance sensor" width="800">
    <figcaption align="center">Connecting a distance sensor to the Pi</figcaption>
</p>

Then execute the following code.

```python
from ICAHSensor import ICAHSensor
from time import sleep

sensor = ICAHSensor(trig=4, echo=18)

while True:
    print('Distance to nearest object is', sensor.get_distance(), 'm')
    sleep(0.5)
```

You can stop the program by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

You can find many more ways of using gpiozero [here](http://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html).

## Exercises

Feel free to team up for these challenges. We only have a limited amount of each sensor.

1. Write a program that flashes an LED at a frequency set by the user.

1. Using gpiozero's [PWMLED object](http://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html#led-with-variable-brightness), write a program that repeatedly dims the LED from zero to full brightness, abruptly re-sets it to zero brightness and repeats. This is called a sawtooth wave.

    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/Sawtooth.gif" alt="pin" width="300">
        <figcaption align="center">A sawtooth wave</figcaption>
    </p>

1. Write a program that blinks an LED if it detects an object closer than 20cm from the distance sensor.

1. Write a program that accepts user input like "HELLOCANYOUHEARME" (all upper case and no whitespace), and translates this into an LED flashing the corresponding Morse Code.

   You will need to translate letters into dots and dashes according to the Morse alphabet. It is best to use a Python dictionary to translate between letters and Morse symbols. This can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypilearning/morse-code-virtual-radio/master/code/morse_lookup.py), and the timing rules for International Morse Code [here](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/morse-code-virtual-radio/blob/master/worksheet.md#decode-the-morse-as-you-go).

1. Write a program that makes use of a line sensor (we have a few here today, so you will need to team up, depending on who is at this stage) and notifies the user whenever a black line is detected. Try to avoid repeatedly printing out whatever the line sensor sees. Instead, only notify the user when there is a change (no line &#8646; line). You will want to [wire it up correctly and familiarise yourself with the LineSensor interface](http://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_input.html#line-sensor-trct5000) in gpiozero.

## Conclusion

We hope you enjoyed this brisk walk through our topic. If things still seem a bit disjointed, fear not &ndash; during the next session, we will start joining up the dots and you will build a physical contraption controlled by your Raspberry Pi!

Just make sure to keep track of the number on your Pi, so you can resume your work where you left it today.
